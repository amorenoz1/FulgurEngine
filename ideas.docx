Game Engine Architecture: C++, GLFW, Vulkan, OpenAL
Creating a game engine involves a modular design where various systems interact to bring a game to life. Below is a high-level structure, detailing the main components and their proposed C++ classes and header files.

1. Core Engine & Application Layer
This layer acts as the orchestrator, managing the lifecycle of the engine and its main loop.

Header Files:

Application.hpp: An abstract base class or interface for game-specific applications to inherit from.

EngineLogger.hpp: For logging engine events, errors, and warnings.

Timer.hpp: Manages delta time and frame rate.

Classes:

Engine: The central class that initializes and manages all other systems (rendering, audio, input, etc.), and runs the main game loop.

Application: An interface that concrete game applications implement (e.g., MyGameApp would inherit from this). It provides methods like OnInitialize(), OnUpdate(float deltaTime), OnRender(), OnShutdown().

Logger: Provides static methods for different logging levels (Info, Warn, Error, Debug).

Timer: Calculates frame time, total elapsed time.

It's standard practice in C++ to use .hpp for header files that contain class declarations and definitions, reserving .h for C-style headers or very simple declarations. Your existing use of .hpp is consistent with modern C++ projects.

This structure provides a comprehensive, yet flexible, foundation for your game engine. Each system can be developed and tested somewhat independently, making the monumental task more manageable. Good luck with your engine development!
